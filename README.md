These are edits.
I made these.
I made these edits in a branch.
The branch name is not visible on this screen.
I do not remember what name I gave this branch.
Luckily, I do not use computers very much. I use paper and pencil.
My paper tells me that this branch is called: "readme-edits."
Thank goodness for paper!
